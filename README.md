An e-commerce website for keycaps and keyboard switches! A variety of high quality keycaps and switches on display. I built this website using React, providing a fast and user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing products. 

## Features 
* Browse a collection of keycaps and switches.
* Filter the keycaps by type, to find exactly what you're looking for.
* Add items to your cart and update the quantity as you see fit.
* Subscribe to get weekly offers and news.

## Getting started
To start using my website, simply go to the homepage and begin navigating through the website. Featured items will be displayed if you're unsure of what exactly you're after.

When you;ve found an item that you'd like to purchase, click on it to view the item enlarged, on a separate page. Or simply add the item to the cart if you're already happy with it.
